GENERATORS 

a GENERATOR is a function that can stop midway and then continue from where it stopped. Generators are a special class of functions that simplify the task of writing iterators.  A generator is a function that produces a sequence of results instead of a single value, i.e. you generate a series of values.

ITERATORS

In JavaScript an iterator is an object which defines a sequence and potentially a return upon its termination.  The most common iterator in JavaScript is the array iterator, which simply returns each value in the associated array in sequence.
